yMMSL Python bindings
=====================

Welcome to the documentation pages for yMMSL, the YAML version of the Multiscale
Modeling and Simulation Language. At the moment, yMMSL is mainly the
configuration language for the MUSCLE 3 multiscale coupling library.

This library provides Python bindings for yMMSL. With it, you can read and write
yMMSL files, and manipulate them using a Python object representation of their
contents. This documentation gives an overview of the format, and a description
of the Python API.
